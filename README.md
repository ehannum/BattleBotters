BattleBotters
=============

A game where you program a bot to play another game for you and see how far it gets.

Inspired by Progress Quest and Candy Box and the like.

You are put in charge of programming an AI character through a series of dropdown menus of events and responses. You have to make a bot that will progress through a vast and varied open world without killing itself somehow.

Your only interface with the world will be the menu for creating your bot the report your bot gives you. No graphics, no sound, no CSS, just HTML and lots of repeated failure after long periods of waiting!

=============

HOW TO PLAY:

By default, your bot is set up to do 2 things:
1. Walk forward.
2. Tell you how it dies.

Figure it out from there. That's the whole point.
